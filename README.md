New Project Template
========

The following template is my very basic setup for a new project. So far includes Gulp.js, auto Sass compiling, and BrowserSync auto refresh.

__Before you begin coding in a new download/fork of this repo, make sure you run the following commands inside your folder:__

```
$ npm install gulp --save-dev
$ npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
$ npm install browser-sync --save-dev
```
-------

Run the command ```$ gulp watch``` to start watching Sass and Javascript files for changes, compiling all Sass, and auto reload your browser after each change.

__Note:__ The '$' is not included in the actual CLI command. It is just there to represent the CLI command itself. Run everything after '$'.

This boilerplate was created with the help of the [CSS-Tricks Gulp for Beginners](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/) tutorial. For further explanation and additional Gulp tasks, check it out.
